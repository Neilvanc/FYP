    <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to introduce people to the diverse array of plants found in Peninsular Malaysia, many of which have not yet been fully explored or appreciated. We believe that these plants hold immense potential for human well-being, serving as sources of food, medicine, and cultural significance. Our goal is to document, catalog, and share this invaluable wealth of botanical knowledge with the world.</p>

    <h2>Our Initiative:</h2>
    <p>Our ethnobotanical database lies at the heart of our efforts. Meticulously curated and continually updated, it serves as a comprehensive repository of information on the traditional uses of plants across Peninsular Malaysia. From medicinal remedies and culinary applications to cultural rituals, our database offers a holistic perspective on the intricate relationship between people and plants.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Our data is collected firsthand by ethnobotanical teams who engage directly with the Orang Asli (Indigenous peoples) communities. Through collaboration and partnership with local experts, we ensure the accuracy and authenticity of our information.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> We strive for a database that reflects the richness and diversity of Peninsular Malaysia's ethnobotanical landscape, encompassing a wide range of plant species and their uses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Team:</h2>
    <p>Our team consists of experienced ethnobotanists, researchers, and data specialists united by a shared vision. With backgrounds in botany, anthropology, and data science, we employ a multidisciplinary approach to the documentation and dissemination of ethnobotanical knowledge.</p>
